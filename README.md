### Directory structure
- Most of the codes are placed under `./src`.
- Some huge externel modules are placed under `./modules`.
- Models and pictures are stored under `./resource`. Do NOT take the 'NaturePack' OBJs for other usages!
- `pages` should never be used other than testing. However, there are some interesting testing works in it.
